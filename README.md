# thekind
The Kind is a friend's match-making Ai and game that will completely transform the currently addictive and non-sustainable match-making landscape. The loneliness epidemic keeps growing despite all the social media and Tinder-like Apps we have available. We are taking a completely different approach to match-making. 
The project was absorbed/pivoted to the Persona initiative.

Principal techs: 
- RX Swift
- Firestore
- Async programming
- Amazon Rekognition API integration
- SpriteKit powered gameboard
- Mapbox (with custom view/pins/animation)
- MVVM coding and my own view-based architecture, avoid relying heavily on viewcontrollers. The architecture in this projects resembles what Apple created later with SWIFT UI (view as principal), but this is 1 year before. Just makes sense.
